// Redux toolkit
//  1.Store
//   we no longer have to bring Redux DevTools and Redux Thunk
//  into the index.js file. Now we only need configureStore, instead of createStore
 


//  2.Slices
//  Instead of dealing with reducers, actions, and all as separate files and individually
//   creating all those action types, RTK gives us the concept of slices.
//   A slice automatically generates reducers, action types, and action creators.
//    As such, you'll only have to create one folder - slices.



// **We'll make all the same changes, but note that we're no longer returning
//  the entire state - we're just mutating state. It's still
//  immutable under the hood, but this approach may be easier and faster for some.
//   If preferred, you can still return the whole state as an object.
// A slice for posts with our three reducers



// The actions that get generated are the same, we just don't
//  have to write them out individually anymore. From the same file, 
//  we can export all the actions, the reducer,
//  the asynchronous thunk, and one new thing - a selector, which
//   we'll use to access any of the state from a React component instead of using connect.
